CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent

Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.

However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"

This is my solution ~
Firstly, use the command
cat crimescene | grep "CLUE"
to print crimescene and pipe that to search for clue! You will then get your base of clues.

With that,  use the command

cat people | grep "Annabel"

to find all the Annabels. you have 4 annabels, two are male which you can eliminate, which leaves annabel sun and church.

Next, cd into memberships and use the command

AAA Delta_SkyMiles ... | grep "Annabel"

and you will then find Annabel Church is the Annabel that is in clues.

cd into streets and

cat streets | grep "Buckingham"
then cat "Buckingham_Place"

to read the file.

which is:
Annabel Church	F	38	Buckingham Place, line 179

SEE INTERVIEW #699607

cd into interviews and
cat interview-699607

the resulting file is:
However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"

cd into vehicles

use command
touch v2.txt
cat vehicles | grep -A 6 "L337" > v2.txt
cat v2.txt | grep -A 6 "9" > v2.txt
cat v2.txt | grep -A 5 -B 1 "Honda" > v2.txt
cat v2.txt | grep -A 4 -B 2 "Blue" > v2.txt
cat v2.txt | grep -A 2 -B 4 "6" > v2.txt

Which will
give u 4 suspects

Erika, Joe, Jeremy and Jacquie

cd into memberships and use the command

cat AAA Museum_of_Bash_History Terminal_City_Library Delta_SkyMiles | grep -c "Jacqui Maher"

which will elimate Joe and Erika

Finally, cd into people, and
cat people | grep “Jeremy Bower”

Since Jacquie is female,
JEREMY IS THE KILLER!
